/*
 * This file contains tasks related to the basics of C programming.
 * Each section includes tasks for different C programming concepts.
 */

/* 
 * Task Section: Start.c
 * Task 1: Modify the Start.c file to declare and initialize a new double variable, then print its value to the console.
 * Task 2: Create a new string variable to store your favorite hobby and print it using printf.
 * Task 3: Read an integer value from the user, multiply it by 2, and print the result.
 * Task 4: Add a new boolean variable to indicate whether it's raining, and print its value.
 * Task 5: Experiment with different format specifiers in printf to display a float with 3 decimal places.
 */

/* 
 * Task Section: Condition.c
 * Task 1: Modify the Condition.c file to include a nested if-else statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
 * Task 2: Add a switch statement to check the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.) and print the corresponding day.
 * Task 3: Implement a program that reads a character from the user and checks if it's a vowel or a consonant.
 * Task 4: Use an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd, and print the result.
 * Task 5: Extend the switch statement to handle a default case that prints "Invalid day" for any input outside 1 to 7.
 */

/* 
 * Task Section: Loop.c
 * Task 1: Modify the Loop.c file to include a nested loop that prints a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5.
 * Task 2: Create a program that uses a while loop to sum the numbers from 1 to 10 and print the result.
 * Task 3: Implement a program using a do-while loop to read integers from the user until they enter a negative number.
 * Task 4: Use a for loop to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
 * Task 5: Add a program that uses a for loop to find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
 */

/* 
 * Task Section: Array.c
 * Task 1: Create an array of 5 integers in Array.c, initialize them, and print their values using a loop.
 * Task 2: Write a program that finds the largest and smallest elements in an array of integers.
 * Task 3: Implement a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of its elements.
 * Task 4: Modify the program to read 5 integers from the user into an array and then print them in reverse order.
 * Task 5: Create a two-dimensional array to represent a 3x3 matrix, initialize it, and print its elements in matrix form.
 */

/* 
 * Task Section: Void.c
 * Task 1: Add a function in Void.c that prints a greeting message including the user's name.
 * Task 2: Implement a function that accepts two integers as parameters and prints their product.
 * Task 3: Create a void function that swaps the values of two integer variables using pointers.
 * Task 4: Write a function that takes an array and its size as parameters, and prints the array elements.
 * Task 5: Add a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width, and prints the result.
